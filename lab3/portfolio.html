    <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a senior completing a bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in English Literature. (You could say that I'm a romantic.)
          I have served in our military as a pharmacy technician and completed 2 years of service. I was honorable discharged in 2019 for medical related reasons. It was a sad time for me as that had been my one and only plan at the time. With this in mind, I had to quickly think of a new plan for my future going forward.</br>
          I quickly decided that I would enjoy a career in technology working with computers and code to provide inoovation to the world. With coding, I feel I can be most creative person while learning new processes and programs. Over the years, I would say my passion for computing has inceased greatly with each new aspect of programming that I have learned. I hope to create many amazing and useful projects throughout my career and life! </br></br>
